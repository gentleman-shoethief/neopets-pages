# neopets-pages
i am learning html and css, and this is where i'm keeping my css. i think.

wow i can. write in github, that's neat.

anyhow, this is where i am putting my css code for my neopets pages so that i can learn html and css. maybe later i will fix my tumblr page (i pasted the css from the spamton sweepstakes way back when into the style editor and it now it wont go back.)
