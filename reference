		<p>now i will list things in order of importance, from most important to least important:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>going to seattle</li>
			<li>seattle</li>
			<li>coffee</li>
			<li>lupin related media</li>
			<li>free bones</li>
			<li>medicaid</li>
			<li>breakfast</li>
			<li>a bird</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>		of course, that was only a few of the things i could have listed. if i wanted to list any more, i would have to make some very difficult decisions, and perhaps even contemplate my life choices, (bad thing.)
		<p>now i will be making a 
			<a href="">hyperlink</a>
				, as i decided halfway through the w3schools html tutorial that i would do the mozilla html tutorial instead.</p>
