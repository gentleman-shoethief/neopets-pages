# neopets-pages
i am learning html and css, and this is where i'm keeping my css. i think.

wow i can. write in github, that's neat.

anyhow, this is where i am putting my css code for my neopets pages so that i can learn html and css. maybe later i will fix my tumblr page (i pasted the css from the spamton sweepstakes way back when into the style editor and it now it wont go back.)

if you want any of this code for some reason, i guess you can have it? this is my first time doing html so i don't see why you might want it, but you do you.
